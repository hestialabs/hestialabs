## Vision

Hestia Labs exists to redefine how people interact with their homes.

The goal is to build a home that behaves like an operating system — structured, predictable, intelligent, and fully under the user’s control. Instead of fragmented apps and disconnected devices, Hestia aims to create a single, integrated ecosystem powered by AI.

---

## Long-Term Direction

- Homes that understand intent, not just commands  
- Automation that feels natural, not scripted  
- Intelligence that enhances daily life without compromising privacy  
- A system built from the ground up to be secure, reliable, and extensible  

---

## Mission

Hestia Labs is not just building smart devices.  
It is building the foundation for intelligent environments — where AI becomes the orchestration layer of physical space.
